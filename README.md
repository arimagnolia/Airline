# Airline

This was the final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms II class in Fall '21.  It uses graph algorithms (Djikstra's Shortest Path and Breadth-First Search) to construct routes between cities.  Routes can be between two cities or have a pitstop.  Some code repeats because I didn't have the time to restructure the code to add helper functions.
